## Notable Features

#### Organize your tabs into Portals

Create portals to separate your browsing based on subject, whether they're work, play, or something else. Portal intelligently orders your workspaces based on relevance and shows previews of your open tabs so that you can easily remember where you left off.

#### Preview websites in split screen view

Hold 'X' and click on any link to see a preview of the page, preventing the unnecessary mindless CMD + Click to open links in new tabs (hey, we're all guilty of it). Then, convert it to a new tab, or close it immediately.

#### Create templates to open pre-defined tabs

Create a set of tabs for every occasion. Then, choose a template while creating a portal to quickly dive in to your task with all the websites you need already open.

View, sort, and even preview your browsing history to easily find pages you've visited before.
